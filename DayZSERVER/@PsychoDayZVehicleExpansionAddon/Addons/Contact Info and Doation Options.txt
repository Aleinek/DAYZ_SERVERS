Thank you for your intereste in the PsychoDayZ Vehicle Expansion - Addon!

We have 13 military vehilces and 5 more civilian vehilces to the lineup over time! We need support to make this happen 
and this is the reason we have decide to make this pack for donators only! Without your support on this 
this addon we would not be able to grow and continue our work!

Some of the new features you will see on these vehilces are GPS Systems, Radar, Moving Engine Functions, Damage/Damage Repair, folding entry steps and 
vehilce painting via a spray can! All of this has taken us alot of time and has cost us quiet a bit already, consider supporting us and getting some really 
nice vehilces for your servers!

We can for an additional donation make custom skins for you as you desire with you server logos, names ect if you wish to inquire about this as well!


What is included as of right now:

F150 Offroad - Damage and Paint System
